\description{
A generated dataset on the survival rates of 250 populations (each composed of 100 individuals) exposed to the stressors of temperature and pH.
The dataset uses a factorial design comprising four treatments: i) Control conditions; ii) Exposed to temperature;
iii) Exposed to pH; iv) Exposed to both temperature and pH. This generated dataset is used in the examples for each function in the multiplestressR package.
Please note that this is a generated dataset and does not reflect data from actual ecological experiments.
